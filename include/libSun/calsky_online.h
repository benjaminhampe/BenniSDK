	/// worse would be corrupted data without any hint that its incorrect, so pls use with care
	/// The other CalSky algorithm is a fast offline approximation from an external source valid within years 2008 till 2028
	/// with an estimated maximum error of 3 min. at 65Â° North ( more higher latitudes have higher errors )
